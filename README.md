Hybrid Cloud Architecture with VMware and AWS
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a hybrid cloud architecture that integrates on-premises VMware vSphere with AWS cloud resources.
The goal is to enable seamless application operations across both environments with features like automatic failover, workload distribution, and real-time monitoring.

Features
AWS Cloud Setup:
Provisioned and configured EC2 instances with secure access.
IAM users and roles configured for controlled permissions.
Automated infrastructure deployment using Terraform.
Performance monitoring using CloudWatch and alerts via SNS.

VMware Integration:
Established secure connectivity between VMware and AWS using AWS Direct Connect or VPN.

Configured workload migration and failover mechanisms.
Automation & Monitoring:
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementation with Terraform.
Real-time system monitoring using AWS CloudWatch.

Technologies Used
Cloud Platform: AWS (EC2, IAM, CloudWatch, SNS)
Hybrid Cloud Solution: VMware vSphere, AWS Direct Connect/VPN
IaC Automation: Terraform
Monitoring Tool: AWS CloudWatch

How to Run the Project
Prerequisites
1. AWS account with admin privileges.
